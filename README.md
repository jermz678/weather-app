# weather-app


Welcome to my weather App!
Using the openweather API, I am displaying current weather
as well as a 5 day forecast.

I used HTML, CSS, JAVASCRIPT, Jqery, DayJs, Google Fonts, and the OpenWeather API.

User can type in a city, and will be shown current weather as well as five day forecast.
UV index is color coded.
User's recent searches will be displayed as buttons, and those can be clicked on to search for them again.
